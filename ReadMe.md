# Java Programming Codes Repository

This repository is an archive of beginner-level Java programs I developed as part of an introductory programming course during a university course (CSC301: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java). It contains various simple projects and exercises written and executed in the **Eclipse IDE**. These codes cover essential Java programming concepts and serve as a foundation for learning object-oriented programming.
It is aimed at showcasing my fundamental Java skills and offering a resource for revisiting or demonstrating foundational programming concepts.
